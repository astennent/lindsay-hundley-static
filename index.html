                    <h4> Thinking About National Interest </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> National Interest </strong> Things strictly necessary to maintain the well-being and state to be a free and wealthy nation. 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> What makes a something a “good” national interest, according to Rice? </strong> 
                            [Note: The following contains a lot of opinions of C.R. There is not one true “fact” about what can or cannot be considered the national interest.] 
                            <ul>
                                <li> Must have a defined end goal.
                                <li> Must be explicitly good for the United States, not just the international community as a whole. (for example, Rice does not think we should define upholding international law as part of our national interest, unless we have a stake in the area at hand). 
                                <li> Means must match the ends. 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> What is in the national interest of the United States, according to Rice (circa 2000)? </strong> [Note: These are actually listed explicitly on 46-47 of her article.] 
                            <ul>
                                <li> To ensure that America’s military can deter war, project power, and fight in defense of its interests. 
                                <li> To promote economic growth and political openness by extending free trade and a stable international monetary system to all committed to these values. [Note: This is where I would distinguish Rice’s neo-conservative ideology from the theory/world-view of political realism. I’ve attached an article by John Mearsheimer that talks more explicitly about the two.] 
                                <li> To renew strong and intimate relationships with allies who share American values and thus capable of sharing the burden of promoting peace. 
                                <li> To focus U.S. energies on comprehensive relationships on large powers, in particular Russia and China. 
                                <li> To deal decisively with threats of rogue regimes and hostile powers (threat of terrorism and WMD acquisition). 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> Are there other ways to define the national interest? </strong> YES!!! One of the points Ken made in class is that the vagueness and broadness of what constitutes the national interest can radically expand the policies that can be justified as “serving the national interest.” In general, realists tend to believe that the national interests are material and include maintaining our position in the international system, but it is certainly possible to conceive of the national interest as including other things. [Note: This is particularly true when we consider instrumental concerns about “leadership” and “credibility.”]

                            <ul> <li> Other things that could be included on list of national interest: humanitarian motives, upholding international law, contributing to the development of poorer countries, etc.  </li> </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4> A Few Notes on the Realist/National Interest Model: </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You can’t critique realism because it paints a pretty “dim” world that you don’t really like. Just because the world they paint is bleak, it doesn’t mean the theory is incorrect. </li>
                        <li> Realism does not believe in “throwing” military force around. Many prominent realists, like Morgenthau, Waltz, and Mearsheimer have been some of the most outspoken against the wars of their day. </li>
                    </ul>
