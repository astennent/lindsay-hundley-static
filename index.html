<h4> 
    Class Reminders
</h4>
<ul>
    <li> WIM Students: I’ll have feedback to you by the start of class on Tuesday. Remember, you’ll need to submit your original draft with my comments attached with your final paper.  
    <li> Non-WIM Students – Papers are due, both by email and in hard-copy, at the beginning of class on Tuesday. If you want to send me an outline or draft by Friday, I’ll be able to get feedback to you by Saturday evening. 
    <li> Papers are due both via email and in hard-copy at the beginning of class. 
    <li> A Few writing notes:
    <ul>
        <li> U.S. is an adjective, not a noun. United States is a noun. 
        “U.S. interests in the Middle East” vs. “The United States has interests in the Middle East.” 
        <li> Please try to refrain from using “this” without following it with a noun. Although we use “this” without a subsequent noun all the time when we are talking, it is best to avoid using it this way in formal writing.
        <li> Do not use contractions in your paper, like “can’t” and “don’t.” Contractions are not appropriate for formal writing. 
        <li> Avoid passive voice, and be careful not to rely on really long sentences.
        <li> Just a general pet peeve: If you can, avoid using the word “says.” It’s bland, and it doesn’t convey as much information as words you could use in its place (i.e. argues, claims, provides evidence, hypothesizes, supports, etc).
    </ul>
    <li> Section Homework: I’d really encourage you to write as if you were writing a mini-thesis for the Paper #2 prompt. If you write your response like a mini-thesis, then the feedback I give you will be useful for writing your papers. Also, if there’s anything in particular you would want feedback on, feel free to include that in the email when you send me your paragraph. I really want these exercises and the feedback I give to be as helpful to you as possible.
</ul>
</h4>
    Section Objectives
</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Describe Kennan’s (a.k.a. “X”) policy of containment as well as the logic underlying the policy, and explain how it came to justify U.S. involvement in Vietnam. 
    <li> Identify the main forces shaping U.S. policy towards Vietnam according to Herring (2015). Be sure to consider why the U.S. used force, the timing of that force, the goals of military action, the military strategies use, and what could/should have been done differently.
    <li> Debate whether U.S. involvement in Vietnam resulted from domestic pressures and whether these pressures prevented the U.S. from winning the war. 
</ol>
<h4>
Reading Review
</h4>
<ul>
<li> Kennan (1946) – Kennan explains that the leaders of the Soviet Union truly saw themselves at war with capitalism and used the “capitalist threat” to justify and maintain its totalitarian control over their people. Its Marxist ideology would like the Soviet Union to seek expansion but on an indefinite time table. The best way to counter the Soviet Union as a political rival would be a “patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies” (575). The United States would not be able to “defeat” the Soviet Union in a single battle. However, Kennan believed the leadership’s cruel treatment of its own people and its economic underdevelopment would ultimately lead to its own demise. 
<li> Herring (2015) – The assigned chapters in Herring narrate the history of the Vietnam War. Herring first describes LBJ’s “goldilocks” approach to the South Vietnam between 1963 and1965, which eventually results in a full-scale commitment the war. In the lead up to the 1964 election, LBJ feared that walking away from Vietnam would (1) allow opponents to criticize him for being too weak on foreign policy and (2) embolden the Soviet Union and China to challenge U.S. resolve elsewhere. 
Herring then explains the why the United States adopted the strategies it did in the war. He argues that the United States, at the outset of the conflict, operated on the unexamined assumption that victory would only require the application of its vast military power. As the conflict continued to deteriorate, tensions between the White House and the military began to rise. Military commanders refused to adapt their strategies to accommodate the political restrictions imposed by the White House. While they did not directly challenge the president, they did try to circumvent the restrictions when implementing orders on the ground. The result, according to Herring, “was considerable ambiguity in purpose and method, growing civil-military tensions, and a steady escalation that brought increasing costs and uncertain gain” (179). 
<br>
In many ways the Tet Offensive marked the real turning point of the war. Even though the Tet Offensive was technically a major military defeat of the enemy, it was a major psychological and political victory for the North Vietnamese. The Tet Offensive sent shock waves across the nation. Public opposition to the war skyrocketed, and major student protests began to break out across the country. Eventually, public opposition led LBJ announce that he would not seek re-election. 
Enter Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. After winning the 1968 Presidential election, Nixon adopted a strategy of “Vietnamization,” which sought to reduce U.S. troop presences and shift the responsibility of the war back to South Vietnam. At the same time however, Nixon rapidly expanded the scope of the war by launching coercive airstrikes in Cambodia and Laos. These sporadic bombing campaigns were aimed at illustrating resolve in order to gain a better bargaining position in peace negotiations with North Vietnam. 
</ul>

<h4>The Policy of Containment</h4>
<p>
Kennan’s idea of “containment”—or at least, a modified version of it—became the foundation for the Truman administration’s foreign policy. While Kennan saw the Soviets as primarily a “political threat,” Kennan’s successor, Paul Nitze, saw the threat posed as primarily a military one. In contrast to Kennan, who advocated primarily for economic assistance and “psychological warfare,” Nitze advocated for increased militarization and solidification of international alliances. Nitze’s conception of containment eventually won over Kennan’s, resulting in Truman signing the NSC 68. This policy called for an expansion of the military budget and expanded containment’s scope beyond the defense of the world’s major economic powers to the entire world. This expansion of scope came to define the domino theory, which would eventually provide a justification for intervention in Vietnam. “In the context of the present polarization of power,” the NSC 68 reads, “a defeat of free institutions anywhere is a defeat everywhere.”
</p><p>
Containment, as formulated in U.S. policy, then possessed diplomatic, economic and military elements. Policymakers came to believe that the loss of South Vietnam to communism would embolden movements in the region and increase the risk of takeovers elsewhere. Relatedly, U.S. policymakers feared that failing to protect South Vietnam would undermine the credibility of U.S. commitments around the world. Not only would our failure weaken our alliances, it could also tempt the Soviet Union and China to test our resolve elsewhere. 
</p><p>
An Interesting Aside: George Kennan was actually one of the most outspoken critics of the Vietnam War. In “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” Kennan failed to draw a clear distinction between what he believed to be vital areas of interests (i.e. major economic centers) and peripheral ones. (Let this failure be a lesson to us all—namely, the importance of the clarity of our writing.)
After the end of the Cold War, Kennan remained an active critic of U.S. foreign policy. He urged the United States to “withdraw its public advocacy of democracy and human rights,” arguing that “the tendency to see ourselves as the center of political enlightenment and as teachers to a great part of the rest of the world strikes me as unthought-through, vainglorious, and undesirable.” Three years before passing away, Kennan also warned against the second war in Iraq. He argued both that the war bore “no relations to the first war against terrorism” and that there was no way to anticipate what the war could become. 

<h4> Explaining Military Strategy in Vietnam </h4>

<table class="narrow-columns">

<tr><td>

Why did the United States use force?

<td>

<ul>
<li> <strong> International Factors: </strong> Containment, Domino Theory, U.S. Credibility (commitments and resolve)
<br><br>
<li> <strong> Domestic Factors: </strong> Anticipated Criticism from Southern Democrats/Republican Party, Linkage between success of Great Society program and success of conflict, Maintained members of Kennedy’s Cabinet who had an individual stake it Vietnam’s outcome.

<tr><td>
What explains the timing of U.S. escalation? 
<td>  
<ul> 
<li>Deteriorating conditions in South Vietnam, particularly instability in the government
<li>Gulf of Tonkin Incident
<li>1964 Election – LBJ to avoid a major escalation in lead up to the election. Increase commitment after the election, but done more privately because of campaign promise of “no wider war” and concerns about Great Society program.

<tr><td>
What were U.S. goals? What would have victory looked like?  
<td>
<ul>
<li><strong> Goals: </strong> Maintain U.S. Credibility, Prevent South Vietnam (SV) and surrounding countries from falling to communism. 
<br><br>
<li><strong> Victory: </strong> Political reforms in SV to diminish Vietcong insurgency/stabilize SV government, End North Vietnamese support for insurgency. 

<tr><td>
What military strategies did the United States use? 
<td>
<ul>
<li><strong> Under LBJ: </strong> Counter-insurgency in SV and enclave strategy, Operation Rolling Thunder – coercive bombing campaign in NV
<br><br>
<li><strong> Under Nixon: </strong>“Vietnamization” (reduce U.S. troop presence, shift responsibility back to SV), short bombing campaigns/other coercive actions.

<tr><td>
Why was this strategy chosen?
<td>
<ul>
<li><strong> Johnson’s “Goldilocks” Approach: </strong> Could not walk away from commitment for strategic and/or domestic reasons. Major escalation of force and unrestrained use of ground troops too costly politically (See Slide in Lecture 6). Military advocated for a “fast and full squeeze” approach attacking major industries and military targets while civilians advocated a “slow squeeze” in a gradual series of attacks. 
<br><br>
<li><strong> Nixon’s Approach: </strong> By time he entered office, most of the public was against Vietnam. Many people in the government came to believe that Vietnam was a huge mistake, and Nixon campaigned on the promise of ending the war. Nixon homed that “Vietnamization” would appease voters at home and reduce U.S. casualties. At the same time, he hoped to achieve a “peace with honor,” which would require being able to demonstrate credibly that the U.S. was resolved to inflict high costs on NV. 

<tr><td>
Why was U.S. strategy unsuccessful?    
<td> 
<ul>
<li> Asymmetries of resolve - North Vietnam and Vietcong Insurgents had more at stake and were willing to fight harder for those interests. 
<li>Coercive bombing campaigns not necessarily suited for COIN operations, and military strategies generally ignored the local context of the fight. 
<li>Domestic dissent constrained the strategies the U.S. military could have taken that would have been successful.

                    <hr>
                    

<h4>SECTION OBJECTIVES:</h4>
<ol> 
    <li> Explain the arguments in both Howell and Pevehouse (2005) and Samples (2011), regarding how Congress can affect Presidential decisions regarding the use of force. 
    <li>Differentiate between limited (or minor) conflicts and war proper (major conflicts) and explain how the type of conflict affects the way Congress is able to exert control over the President. 
    <li>Apply this material (and material from earlier) to the case of non-intervention in Syria. Explain whether or not President Obama would have been willing to Intervene. 
</ol>

<h4> READING REVIEW: </h4>
<p> Howell and Pevehouse (2005) – The authors argue that Presidents are able to anticipate the level of support they will receive from Congress, based on co-partisanship control or not, and the President will only pursue policies with which they can “get away.” Co-partisan Congresses are more likely to support the President on foreign policy (see pages 215 – 216 for reasons why), which allows the Presidents to initiate conflicts abroad more easily.  They find that co-partisanship control of Congress is a statistically significant predictor of whether the President initiates a major conflict abroad. </p>

<p> Samples (2011) – Samples describes how Congress has relinquished war-making powers to the President over time. While the President still seeks Congressional approval for major military conflicts, Samples argues that the President has de facto power over decisions regarding limited military action. The public is highly skeptical of these limited conflicts and expressly prefers that the President seeks Congressional approval in these cases as well. The President, however, still does not. A major concern of Samples is that at the same time Congress is relinquishing its power over military decisions to the president, the president seems to be taking steps in deferring this power to international bodies, like the United Nations. </p>

<h4> LIMITED VS MAJOR MILITARY CONFLICTS:  </h4>
<p> The distinction between limited versus major military conflicts is important because the theories from our readings suggests that it affects the extent to which Congress is able to exert influence over the President’s decisions regarding the use of force. A limited conflict is one in which very few American casualties are expected at the outset of the conflict. Because these conflicts tend not to be as salient politically (because few Americans die), both Samples and Howell and Pevehouse suggest that Congress exerts very little influence over Presidential decisions. [Food for thought: Do you think this still holds? Remember Howell and Pevehouse wrote published their paper in 2005, and Samples published his shortly after our conflict in Libya]. </p>


<h4> THINKING ABOUT THE PAPERS: </h4> 
<p> In general, there are two main approaches to answering the question in the paper prompt (as indicated in the prompt). </p>
<ol>
    <li> You can argue that President Obama would have been willing to follow through on this threat. Because President Obama would have followed through on his threat (i.e. the threat was credible), Syria gave up its chemical weapons in the deal brokered with Russia. 

    <li> If you make this argument, you  need to explain why President Obama would have followed through on his military threat, as well as why he would have been able to do so in the face of domestic opposition from other key players (military, Congress, public opinion). 

    <li> You can argue that President Obama would not have been able to follow through on his threat. President Obama only accepted the deal brokered by Russia because he would not have been able to follow through on his military threat. 
    <br>
    If you make this argument, you will need to explain which actors were preventing him from using military force and why they were able to “exert control” over him. You will also need to explain why he would not have been willing to follow through in spite of domestic opposition. 
</ol>
<p> <strong> Important: </strong> Remember, the task at hand is to explain non-intervention, not to give your (well-informed) opinions about what President Obama should have done or what role other actors should (or should not) play in the war-making process.
Here are a few factors that you may want to consider in working through your argument: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Reason for Redline/(Possibility of)Intervention
    <li> Would Syria be a limited or major military endeavor? (Again, important because it could affect how you think Congress would be able/willing to limit the President). 
    <li> Who are the Key Players (broadly defined—remember, you do not need to look to outside sources for the paper)? 
    <ul>
        <li> What are their motivations? 
        <li>How do these motivations affect their position on intervention? 
        <li> How are they able to influence the decision-making process on war? (i.e. Why they may or may not matter). 
    </ul>
    <li> Counterfactual: What if Russia had not brokered a deal with Syria? 
    <ul>
        <li> What would Congress have done? 
        <li> Given what Congress would have done, what do you think President Obama would have done? 
        <li> How would public opinion have responded?    
    </ul>
</ul>

                    <h4> Theoretical Lenses </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> Realist Model </strong> - Focuses on the role of national interest and the relative power of adversaries. Intervention or non-intervention can be explained by identifying whether the United States had a lot at stake in the conflict.
                            <br>
                            You should also think about the role of national interest and relative power in determining the credibility of threats. In particular, if you can communicate that you have a lot at stake when issuing a military threat, then the receiver of that threat is more likely to believe that you are willing to following through on military action if they do not back down. Similarly, if you are very strong relative to your opponent, your opponent may think that it is more likely that you will follow through on your threat (you’re more likely to follow through on threats if you think you are likely to win a conflict). I’ve attached a reading by Thomas Schelling on the problem of effectively communicating resolve (i.e. a willingness to follow through on threats), for those who are interested. 
                            <br>
                            Importantly, stakes and relative power are not the only factors affecting credibility of military threats. Can you think of any others? 
                        </li> <li>
                            <strong> Bureaucratic Politics Model </strong> - Abandons the “state as a unitary actor” model. Allison and Halperin (1972) write: 
                            <br>
                            “The ‘maker’ of the government policy is not one calculating decision-maker, but rather a conglomerate of large organizations and political actors who differ substantively about what their government should do on any particular issue and who compete in attempting to affect both governmental decisions and the actions of their governments.” 
                            <br>
                            An interesting feature of the BP model is that organizational cultures can lead different actors in the government to have different views on what the national interest is, not just that they have competing interest within the government. These competing interests or views of what the proper national interest is can limit made available in the decision making process.
                            <br>
                            Another noteworthy feature is thinking about how the decision-making process and the implementation process can interact with each other. Since those making decisions are often not the same people/organizations who implement them, decision-makers need to think about whether or not those implementing their decision will try to promote their own interests. 


                        </li> <li> 
                            <strong> Domestic Politics Model </strong> Also abandons the “state as a unitary actor” model. So far, we’ve talked about two types of explanations that fall within the umbrella of “domestic politics models.” 
                            <ul> 
                                <li> <strong> Diversionary Incentive </strong> - Russett explains that in times of poor economic performance, Presidents may have an incentive to use military force abroad in order to produce a “rally around the flag” effect in the lead up to an election. I’m attaching an article by Amy Oakes on diversionary war for those who are interested. Basically, she argues that when thinking about the incentive to use military action to increase domestic support, you need to examine why governments could not turn to some other, potentially less costly and less risky policy to achieve the same ends. </li>

                                    <strong> Public Opinion </strong>
                                    There are two general models of public opinion: a bottom-up model and a top-down model. 
                                    <br>
                                    In the bottom-up model, events are portrayed through the media (“CNN Effect”), which gives rise to public opinion. Because Presidents want to be re-elected (or elected in the first place), the President will make policy decisions based on what public opinion dictates.  
                                    <br>
                                    In the top-down model, the elites—and in particular, the President—makes decisions based on some combination of the national interest, political/personal interests, and bureaucratic interests. The president is then persuades public opinion to support his policies, suppressing public opinion, or simply ignores it.

                                    We read four readings this week that deal with the role of public opinion and the media in foreign policy, which touch on the following themes:  
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Zaller (1994) – Mainstream vs. polarization effect of elite cues on public opinion. When elite are united in support, the public is generally supportive of President’s policies. When the elite are divided, the public adopts partisan positions and becomes more divided.
                                        <li>Etman and Page (1994) – Coverage of supportive vs. oppositional arguments in the media. Those with most influence over foreign policy get the most coverage. 
                                        <li>Cook (1994) – Explains how newsbeats and attempts for reporters to remain neutral can lead to biased coverage of foreign policy. In particular, the White House, State Department, and Pentagon seem to control discussion, which prevents meaningful dialogue about the case. 
                                        <li>Page and Shapiro (1988) – Shows that public opinion on foreign policy has been relatively stable over time (argues against the view of a “moody” public). They also argue that people seem to respond “reasonably” to the information that is given to them by the media and the elite.

                    <h4> Thinking About National Interest </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> National Interest </strong> Things strictly necessary to maintain the well-being and state to be a free and wealthy nation. 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> What makes a something a “good” national interest, according to Rice? </strong> 
                            [Note: The following contains a lot of opinions of C.R. There is not one true “fact” about what can or cannot be considered the national interest.] 
                            <ul>
                                <li> Must have a defined end goal.
                                <li> Must be explicitly good for the United States, not just the international community as a whole. (for example, Rice does not think we should define upholding international law as part of our national interest, unless we have a stake in the area at hand). 
                                <li> Means must match the ends. 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> What is in the national interest of the United States, according to Rice (circa 2000)? </strong> [Note: These are actually listed explicitly on 46-47 of her article.] 
                            <ul>
                                <li> To ensure that America’s military can deter war, project power, and fight in defense of its interests. 
                                <li> To promote economic growth and political openness by extending free trade and a stable international monetary system to all committed to these values. [Note: This is where I would distinguish Rice’s neo-conservative ideology from the theory/world-view of political realism. I’ve attached an article by John Mearsheimer that talks more explicitly about the two.] 
                                <li> To renew strong and intimate relationships with allies who share American values and thus capable of sharing the burden of promoting peace. 
                                <li> To focus U.S. energies on comprehensive relationships on large powers, in particular Russia and China. 
                                <li> To deal decisively with threats of rogue regimes and hostile powers (threat of terrorism and WMD acquisition). 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> Are there other ways to define the national interest? </strong> YES!!! One of the points Ken made in class is that the vagueness and broadness of what constitutes the national interest can radically expand the policies that can be justified as “serving the national interest.” In general, realists tend to believe that the national interests are material and include maintaining our position in the international system, but it is certainly possible to conceive of the national interest as including other things. [Note: This is particularly true when we consider instrumental concerns about “leadership” and “credibility.”]

                            <ul> <li> Other things that could be included on list of national interest: humanitarian motives, upholding international law, contributing to the development of poorer countries, etc.  </li> </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4> A Few Notes on the Realist/National Interest Model: </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You can’t critique realism because it paints a pretty “dim” world that you don’t really like. Just because the world they paint is bleak, it doesn’t mean the theory is incorrect. </li>
                        <li> Realism does not believe in “throwing” military force around. Many prominent realists, like Morgenthau, Waltz, and Mearsheimer have been some of the most outspoken against the wars of their day. </li>
