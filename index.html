                        <strong> Week 3 </strong> Congress and War
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    

<h4>SECTION OBJECTIVES:</h4>
<ol> 
    <li> Explain the arguments in both Howell and Pevehouse (2005) and Samples (2011), regarding how Congress can affect Presidential decisions regarding the use of force. 
    <li>Differentiate between limited (or minor) conflicts and war proper (major conflicts) and explain how the type of conflict affects the way Congress is able to exert control over the President. 
    <li>Apply this material (and material from earlier) to the case of non-intervention in Syria. Explain whether or not President Obama would have been willing to Intervene. 
</ol>

<h4> READING REVIEW: </h4>
<p> Howell and Pevehouse (2005) – The authors argue that Presidents are able to anticipate the level of support they will receive from Congress, based on co-partisanship control or not, and the President will only pursue policies with which they can “get away.” Co-partisan Congresses are more likely to support the President on foreign policy (see pages 215 – 216 for reasons why), which allows the Presidents to initiate conflicts abroad more easily.  They find that co-partisanship control of Congress is a statistically significant predictor of whether the President initiates a major conflict abroad. </p>

<p> Samples (2011) – Samples describes how Congress has relinquished war-making powers to the President over time. While the President still seeks Congressional approval for major military conflicts, Samples argues that the President has de facto power over decisions regarding limited military action. The public is highly skeptical of these limited conflicts and expressly prefers that the President seeks Congressional approval in these cases as well. The President, however, still does not. A major concern of Samples is that at the same time Congress is relinquishing its power over military decisions to the president, the president seems to be taking steps in deferring this power to international bodies, like the United Nations. </p>

<h4> LIMITED VS MAJOR MILITARY CONFLICTS:  </h4>
<p> The distinction between limited versus major military conflicts is important because the theories from our readings suggests that it affects the extent to which Congress is able to exert influence over the President’s decisions regarding the use of force. A limited conflict is one in which very few American casualties are expected at the outset of the conflict. Because these conflicts tend not to be as salient politically (because few Americans die), both Samples and Howell and Pevehouse suggest that Congress exerts very little influence over Presidential decisions. [Food for thought: Do you think this still holds? Remember Howell and Pevehouse wrote published their paper in 2005, and Samples published his shortly after our conflict in Libya]. </p>


<h4> THINKING ABOUT THE PAPERS: </h4> 
<p> In general, there are two main approaches to answering the question in the paper prompt (as indicated in the prompt). </p>
<ol>
    <li> You can argue that President Obama would have been willing to follow through on this threat. Because President Obama would have followed through on his threat (i.e. the threat was credible), Syria gave up its chemical weapons in the deal brokered with Russia. 

    <li> If you make this argument, you  need to explain why President Obama would have followed through on his military threat, as well as why he would have been able to do so in the face of domestic opposition from other key players (military, Congress, public opinion). 

    <li> You can argue that President Obama would not have been able to follow through on his threat. President Obama only accepted the deal brokered by Russia because he would not have been able to follow through on his military threat. 
    <br>
    If you make this argument, you will need to explain which actors were preventing him from using military force and why they were able to “exert control” over him. You will also need to explain why he would not have been willing to follow through in spite of domestic opposition. 
</ol>
<p> <strong> Important: </strong> Remember, the task at hand is to explain non-intervention, not to give your (well-informed) opinions about what President Obama should have done or what role other actors should (or should not) play in the war-making process.
Here are a few factors that you may want to consider in working through your argument: </p>
<ol>
    <li> Reason for Redline/(Possibility of)Intervention
    <li> Would Syria be a limited or major military endeavor? (Again, important because it could affect how you think Congress would be able/willing to limit the President). 
    <li> Who are the Key Players (broadly defined—remember, you do not need to look to outside sources for the paper)? 
    <ol>
        <li> What are their motivations? 
        <li>How do these motivations affect their position on intervention? 
        <li> How are they able to influence the decision-making process on war? (i.e. Why they may or may not matter). 
    </ol>
    <li> Counterfactual: What if Russia had not brokered a deal with Syria? 
    <ol>
        <li> What would Congress have done? 
        <li> Given what Congress would have done, what do you think President Obama would have done? 
        <li> How would public opinion have responded?    
    </ol>
</ol>

                    <h4> Theoretical Lenses </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> Realist Model </strong> - Focuses on the role of national interest and the relative power of adversaries. Intervention or non-intervention can be explained by identifying whether the United States had a lot at stake in the conflict.
                            <br>
                            You should also think about the role of national interest and relative power in determining the credibility of threats. In particular, if you can communicate that you have a lot at stake when issuing a military threat, then the receiver of that threat is more likely to believe that you are willing to following through on military action if they do not back down. Similarly, if you are very strong relative to your opponent, your opponent may think that it is more likely that you will follow through on your threat (you’re more likely to follow through on threats if you think you are likely to win a conflict). I’ve attached a reading by Thomas Schelling on the problem of effectively communicating resolve (i.e. a willingness to follow through on threats), for those who are interested. 
                            <br>
                            Importantly, stakes and relative power are not the only factors affecting credibility of military threats. Can you think of any others? 
                        </li> <li> 
                            <strong> Domestic Politics Model </strong> Also abandons the “state as a unitary actor” model. So far, we’ve talked about two types of explanations that fall within the umbrella of “domestic politics models.” 
                            <ul> 
                                <li> <strong> Diversionary Incentive </strong> - Russett explains that in times of poor economic performance, Presidents may have an incentive to use military force abroad in order to produce a “rally around the flag” effect in the lead up to an election. I’m attaching an article by Amy Oakes on diversionary war for those who are interested. Basically, she argues that when thinking about the incentive to use military action to increase domestic support, you need to examine why governments could not turn to some other, potentially less costly and less risky policy to achieve the same ends. </li>
                                <li> 
                                    <strong> Public Opinion </strong>
                                    There are two general models of public opinion: a bottom-up model and a top-down model. 
                                    <br>
                                    In the bottom-up model, events are portrayed through the media (“CNN Effect”), which gives rise to public opinion. Because Presidents want to be re-elected (or elected in the first place), the President will make policy decisions based on what public opinion dictates.  
                                    <br>
                                    In the top-down model, the elites—and in particular, the President—makes decisions based on some combination of the national interest, political/personal interests, and bureaucratic interests. The president is then persuades public opinion to support his policies, suppressing public opinion, or simply ignores it.
                                    <br>
                                    We read four readings this week that deal with the role of public opinion and the media in foreign policy, which touch on the following themes:  
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Zaller (1994) – Mainstream vs. polarization effect of elite cues on public opinion. When elite are united in support, the public is generally supportive of President’s policies. When the elite are divided, the public adopts partisan positions and becomes more divided.
                                        <li>Etman and Page (1994) – Coverage of supportive vs. oppositional arguments in the media. Those with most influence over foreign policy get the most coverage. 
                                        <li>Cook (1994) – Explains how newsbeats and attempts for reporters to remain neutral can lead to biased coverage of foreign policy. In particular, the White House, State Department, and Pentagon seem to control discussion, which prevents meaningful dialogue about the case. 
                                        <li>Page and Shapiro (1988) – Shows that public opinion on foreign policy has been relatively stable over time (argues against the view of a “moody” public). They also argue that people seem to respond “reasonably” to the information that is given to them by the media and the elite. 
                                    </ul>

                    <h4> Thinking About National Interest </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> National Interest </strong> Things strictly necessary to maintain the well-being and state to be a free and wealthy nation. 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> What makes a something a “good” national interest, according to Rice? </strong> 
                            [Note: The following contains a lot of opinions of C.R. There is not one true “fact” about what can or cannot be considered the national interest.] 
                            <ul>
                                <li> Must have a defined end goal.
                                <li> Must be explicitly good for the United States, not just the international community as a whole. (for example, Rice does not think we should define upholding international law as part of our national interest, unless we have a stake in the area at hand). 
                                <li> Means must match the ends. 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> What is in the national interest of the United States, according to Rice (circa 2000)? </strong> [Note: These are actually listed explicitly on 46-47 of her article.] 
                            <ul>
                                <li> To ensure that America’s military can deter war, project power, and fight in defense of its interests. 
                                <li> To promote economic growth and political openness by extending free trade and a stable international monetary system to all committed to these values. [Note: This is where I would distinguish Rice’s neo-conservative ideology from the theory/world-view of political realism. I’ve attached an article by John Mearsheimer that talks more explicitly about the two.] 
                                <li> To renew strong and intimate relationships with allies who share American values and thus capable of sharing the burden of promoting peace. 
                                <li> To focus U.S. energies on comprehensive relationships on large powers, in particular Russia and China. 
                                <li> To deal decisively with threats of rogue regimes and hostile powers (threat of terrorism and WMD acquisition). 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong> Are there other ways to define the national interest? </strong> YES!!! One of the points Ken made in class is that the vagueness and broadness of what constitutes the national interest can radically expand the policies that can be justified as “serving the national interest.” In general, realists tend to believe that the national interests are material and include maintaining our position in the international system, but it is certainly possible to conceive of the national interest as including other things. [Note: This is particularly true when we consider instrumental concerns about “leadership” and “credibility.”]

                            <ul> <li> Other things that could be included on list of national interest: humanitarian motives, upholding international law, contributing to the development of poorer countries, etc.  </li> </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> You can’t critique realism because it paints a pretty “dim” world that you don’t really like. Just because the world they paint is bleak, it doesn’t mean the theory is incorrect. </li>
                        <li> Realism does not believe in “throwing” military force around. Many prominent realists, like Morgenthau, Waltz, and Mearsheimer have been some of the most outspoken against the wars of their day. </li>
